\resheader{Experience}
\ressubheader[| Software Engineer Intern]{Google}{May 2017 - August 2017}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed, trained, and documented machine learning model with \resskill{TensorFlow} to make useful inferences over Android Pay transaction data, increasing coverage over existing model by a margin of 20\% while maintaining the same accuracy.
  \item Implemented serving infrastructure for model in \resskill{Java} and \resskill{TensorFlow Serving}. Launched model in production to support serving inferences to new transactions in real time.
\end{itemize}

\ressubheader[| Member, JV Programming Team]{UCF}{September 2016 - May 2017}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Attended weekly practice competitions to improve problem solving skills and programming ability. Implemented efficient software solutions in \resskill{Java} and \resskill{Python} within a short time-frame. 
  \item Collaborated and communicated with other team members to design and implement creative solutions to challenging problems. Tested solutions to ensure correctness.
\end{itemize}

\ressubheader[| Software Engineer Intern]{DiSTI}{October 2015 - September 2016}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed and maintained leading-edge virtual environment software written in \resskill{C++}. Identified, reported, and resolved bugs in a large code-base.
  \item Tested software solutions and reviewed code written by team members to ensure consistent software quality. Created and improved automated tests using in-house tools, as well as custom \resskill{Python} scripts.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
  \item [Sentiment Classifier:] Developed a natural language sentiment classifier in \resskill{Python} using \resskill{sklearn}, capable of identifying positive or negative tone in bodies of text. Trained using real-world natural language data, preprocessed with \resskill{NLTK}. Incorporated sentiment classifier into larger group project providing stock market news analysis, price prediction, and report generation.
  \item [Connect-4 AI:] Implemented an automated \emph{Connect-4} player from scratch in \resskill{C}. Incorporates probabalistic methods such as Monte-Carlo Search Trees, as well as heuristic techniques from game theory to efficiently achieve near-optimal play.
  %\item [PL/0 Compiler:] Collaborated with a team of two other people to implement, in \resskill{C}, a compiler for the PL/0 programming language. Capable of lexing, parsing, and generating bytecode for PL/0 source files. Implemented virtual machine to test generated bytecode.
  %\item [Text Editor:] Developed a basic graphical plain-text editor in \resskill{Java} using the \resskill{Swing} framework, capable of reading and writing to text files. Constructed UML class diagram to document object relationships.
